📘 - General Regulations
--
*All of the points listed below are considered read and accepted by all users of Mineaurion platforms. When connecting to one of the server platforms, any violation of the rules will be severely reprimanded. If it happens that the Mineaurion Administration wants to modify this regulation for any reason, it has the right to do so. *

**The purpose of a penalty is to enforce the rules according to the mistakes and history of the offending player** Any sanction applied may be explained and justified by a member of the moderation if the guilty player wishes it, because it is set up impartially and respectfully towards the player.

**All users of our platforms are equal, regardless of their rank**They have the same rights under these Regulations and that is why you are asked to be respectful to each other. Respect for others is fundamental to enjoying our services.

If you encounter problems with the moderation or any of its constituent members, please refer to those in charge, if it can not be solve otherwise. The server team is made up of volunteers and they have a lot to do, please take this into account.

📣 - Banned advertising
--
Advertising for your personal interest, such as a Youtube Channel, Dailymotion, Twitch or any server **is prohibited**. Promoting it by private message or on the server chat will result in the player being muted by a member of the staff, unless he/she has Youtubeur/Streameur rank. It is therefore the same on the forum, no advertising is allowed.

If you would like to promote something via our media, please send a request to an admin through the forum.

💬 - Free communication, without any abuse
--
Many means of communication are available to players to offer them an optimal gaming experience on our servers. Messages must be written in an understandable way while respecting the language of the platform (avoid sms language as much as possible).

It goes without saying that it is strictly forbidden to write messages of a sexual, discriminatory, violent, xenophobic, hateful, hateful, rude, offensive, racist or homophobic nature. It is the same for pseudo forum/minecraft/discord and skins/image used or posted on all our platforms. We will ask you to avoid publicizing any political debate or conflict, otherwise you will be punished. And therefore, it seems essential to carry out a reminder of respect for others here.

**Spam, flooding and abusive capital letters are prohibited.**
All types of spam are blocked automatically but it is still forbidden to post a series of meaningless and useless messages, only has to annoy the other players. Messages containing too many uppercase letters that even make the chat unreadable are considered spam

**Youtuber/Streameurs/Partners and team members must be respected in the same way as others.**
You will surely meet more than one of them on the Mineaurion platforms, apart from their popularity on Youtube or via streams, these players also have the right to play comfortably on our servers. Allowing them a normal gaming experience will satisfy you as much as them because they will be able to deliver a quality content in their videos or streams.

Similarly for staff members, they do their best to allow you to spend a good time on the server and enjoy relaxing while playing (these players are volunteers, not professionals either).

Each member is solely responsible for the content it publishes, Mineaurion cannot be held responsible for it. Moderators are recruited to monitor activity on server networks.

👔 - Moderation/Administration Team
--
**Impersonating a member of the moderation team or all other member of the Mineaurion team is prohibited.** Stealing an identity by Nickname, avatar, signature or behaving like a member of the staff is strongly forbidden and can be severely punished.

It is easy to identify a staff member on the server ! They have a rank on the forum next to their nickname and a prefix in front of their nickname on the server that is here :

- Moderators who make sure the server runs smoothly and complies with the rules have the prefix %(#BE0000)[[]%(#FFAC06)[Moderator]%(#BE0000)[]] in front of their nickname.

🎮 - General minecraft server rules
--

**It is strictly %(#BE0000)[forbidden] ...**

- To grief, to borrow without authorization or to steal any property not belonging to you, even outside the claims.
- To use banned items of any kind.
- To exploit glitches related to plugins, server mods or in-game currency.
- To do PVP except with consent. This includes trap systems and machines that allow it.
- To build you base out of the overworld.
- To enter into a player's unauthorized or privatized area.
- Only passive anchors or plugins are allowed to load your base.
- Any changes to the client to provide any advantage to the members.
- Create an economic system or even a parallel shop on our servers.

Trade is however allowed within a certain limit.

Mining on the edges or in a quarry still running is considered as theft.

A claim system is available on all our servers. It is the player's responsability to use it properly.

Systems provoking all kinds of lags (slowing machine, fps loss...) are most likely to be **removed / deleted / regenerated** of a player's base **%(#BE0000)[with or without warning]**. Same for oversized or non-optimised bases.

You can ask the staff team to check whether or not your base is producing lags. You can also see yourself beeing proposed an alternative to optimise it.

**No refund will be done**, except in specific cases (victim of a grief in your claim zone). It is still up to the Mineaurion team to make a refund or not. 


Abusive donations towards a player in any way (energy or items), or anything that allows an easier experience is against our way of playing. This is why it also is forbidden.

Anything considered harmful may be subject to a sanction. Any behaviour may be punished, if the moderation deems it necessary.

⚙️ - Specific rules in Minecraft
--
Naturally, our servers are publics, so you have to **share** the servers resources. **Actually you are not on a singleplayer map**.

**The restrictions are as follows ...**

- One quarry per person and only allowed in the world mining.
- The buildcraft pipes are to be used in a limited quantity (use for apiary, grinder)
- No falling spawner has tolerate(falling entity). **three spawners active at the same time per base** with an extinction system when the player is not connected.
- Moving mobs via fan,conveyer belt or any other system of the same type.
- You must limit or avoid the micro-blocks in your base.
- All anti-afk systems of any shape is prohibited.

The spawners or all type of machine/system creating entities must not allow their accumulation.

Many tutorials and optimizations are available [Here](https://forum.mineaurion.com/category/35/tutoriels). Some serve as a reference; for example [The automation of spawners](https://forum.mineaurion.com/topic/397/tutoriel-pour-optimisation-des-machines).

After many problems in the server bound to conflicts between players of the same base, we have decided the following things :

- If a person leave the base without warning, taking all the machines with him, this will be considered as a steal, and sanctions will be applied.
- If the players can not agree, we will then make half with the resources concerned.
- If never the situation degenerate we will delete the base entirely and the players will have to start again from the beginning.

For this situation, the decision remains at the discretion of the staff.

**Additional rules are provided in the "/rules" of each server.**

🛒 - Purchases and selling
--
The server shop allows to obtain differents ranks, cosmetics or money.The purchase of these items may lead to the obtaining of new machines having as goal to improve the quality of our services, but this is by no means mandatory.

**No purchase will be refunded** either via the site or in-game. Purchases are considered as definitive and the purchaser is responsible of its error in the present case. Purchases in-game will be refunded in case of bug from the server. The procedure consist of contacting a member of %(#BE0000)[red staff] via `@Staff` in the channel #support of discord or directly in-game. It's possible to contact us via support@mineaurion.com. In case of data loss, it is therefore the responsibility of the player to take the necessary steps.

**Minors haves to get the autorisation of their legal tutor**. Mineaurion is in no way responsible for acts commited by minors without the permission of their legal tutor.

No resale from the Mineaurion's shop is allowed. It's quite possible to give a gift to your friends, or to trade but no resale will be tolerated.
