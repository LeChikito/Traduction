📘 - General Regulation
--
*All of the items listed below are considered to be read and accepted by all users of the Mineaurion platforms. When connecting to one one of the server's platforms, any violation of the rules will be severely reprimanded. Should the Mineaurion Administration wish to amend this by-law for any reason, it has the full right to do so.*

**A sanction is intended to enforce the rule based on the errors and history of the offending player** Any sanction applied may be explained and justified by a member of the moderation if the guilty player so wishes, because it is implemented impartially and respectfully towards the player.

**All users of our platforms are equal, regardless of their rank**They have the same rights under these Regulations and that is why you are asked to respect each other. Respect for others is fundamental to the enjoyment of our services.

If you encounter problems with the moderation or any of its constituent members, please refer to the persons in charge, if it is not possible to solve it otherwise. The server team is made up of volunteers and they have a lot to do, please take this into account.

📣 - Banned advertising
--
Advertising for your personal interest, such as a Youtube Channel, Dailymotion, Twitch or any server **is prohibited**. Advertising by private message or on the server chat will result in the player being muted by a member of the staff, unless he/she has Youtubeur/Streameur rank. It is therefore the same on the forum no advertising is allowed.

If you would like to promote something via our media, please send a request to an admin through the forum.

💬 - Free communication, without abuse
--
There are many ways for players to communicate with each other in order to offer them an optimal gaming experience on our servers. Messages must be written in an understandable way while respecting the language of the platform (avoid sms language as much as possible).

It goes without saying that it is strictly forbidden to write messages of a sexual, discriminatory, violent, xenophobic, hateful, hateful, rude, offensive, racist or homophobic nature. The same is true for pseudo forum/minecraft/discord and skins/image used or posted on all our platforms. We will ask you to refrain from making public any political debate or conflict, otherwise you will be punished. And therefore, it seems essential to carry out a reminder of respect for others here.

**Spam, flooding and abusive capital letters are prohibited.**
All types of spam are blocked automatically but it is still forbidden to post a series of meaningless and useless messages, which only has the effect of annoying other players. Messages that contain too many uppercase letters that even make the chat unreadable are considered spam

**Youtuber/Streameurs/Partners and team members must be respected in the same way as others.**
You will surely meet more than one of them on the Mineaurion platforms, apart from their popularity on Youtube or via streams, these players also have the right to play comfortably on our servers. Giving them a normal gaming experience will satisfy you just as much as they do because they can deliver quality content in their videos or streams.

Likewise for the staff members, they do their best to allow you to have a good time on the server and enjoy relaxing while playing (these players are volunteers, not professionals either).

Each member is solely responsible for the content they publish, Mineaurion cannot be held responsible for it. Moderators are recruited to monitor activity on server networks.

- to use banned items in any way.
- to exploit glitches related to plugins, server mods or in-game currency.
- to do PVP except when both (or more) of the players agree. It includes trap systems and machines that allow it.
- to build you base out of the overworld.
- to enter into a player's unauthorized or privatized area.
- Only passive anchors or plugins are allowed to load your base.
- All client modifications which the goal is to gain a benefit compared to any other member.
- Create an economic system or even a parallel shop on our servers.

Trade is however allowed.

Mine on the edges of a quarry still running is considered as theft.

A claim system is available on all our servers. It is the player's responsability to use it properly.

Systems provoking all kinds of lags (slowing machine, fps loss...) are most likely to be **removed** of a player's base **%(#BE0000)[with or without warning]**. Same for oversized or non-optimised bases.

You can ask the staff team to check whether or not your base is producing lags. You can also see yourself beeing proposed an alternative to optimise it.

**Not a single refund will be done**, except in specific cases (victim of a grief in your claim zone). The team will chose whether or not you should get a refund.


Abusive donations toward a player in any way (energy or items), or anything that allows an easier experience is against our way of playing. This is why it also is forbidden.

Anything considered harmful may be subject to a sanction. Any behaviour may be punished, if the moderation deems it necessary.

⚙️ - Specific rules in Minecraft
--
He is of fact that our servers are publics, he must therefore be **share** the servers resources. **effectively you are not on a singleplayer map**.

**The restrictions are therefore as the next ...**

- only once quarry per person in the world mining (Authorized only in the mining world).
- The buildcraft pipes are to be used in a limited quantity (use for apiary, grinder)
- No falling spawner has tolerate(falling entity). **three spawners active at the same time per base** with an extinction system when the player is not connected.
- The moving of mobs via fan,conveyer belt or any other system of the same type.
- The micro-blocks are to limit or avoid in your base.
- All anti-afk systems of any shape is prohibited.

The spawners or all type of machine/system creating entities should not allow their accumulation.

Many tutorials and optimization are at your disposition [Here](https://forum.mineaurion.com/category/35/tutoriels). Some was use as a reference; for example [The automation of spawners](https://forum.mineaurion.com/topic/397/tutoriel-pour-optimisation-des-machines).

After many problems in the server bound to conflicts between players of the same base, we have decided the next thing :

- If a person leave the base without warning, taking all the machines with him, this will be considered as a steal, and sanctions will be applied.
- If the player can not agree, we will then make half with the resources concerned.
- if never the situation degenerate we will delete the base entirely and the players will have to start again from the beginning.

For this situation, the decision remains at the staff assessment.

**The Additional rules are provided in the "/rules" of each server.**
