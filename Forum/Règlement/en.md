🎮 - Minecraft general server rules
--

**It is strictly %(#BE0000)[forbidden] ...**

- to grief, borrow without autorisation or steal goods that are not yours.
- to use banned items in any way.
- to exploit glitches either linked to plugins, mods or server currency in-game.
- to do PVP except when both (or more) of the players agree. It includes trap systems and machines that allow it.
- to build you base out of the overworld.
- to step into a player's non-authorized or privatised zone.
- Only passive anchors or plugins are allowed to load your base.
- All client modifications which the goal is to gain a benefit compared to any other member.
- Create an economic system or even a parallel shop on our servers.

Trade is however allowed.

Mine on the edges of a quarry still running is considered as theft.

A claim system is available on all our servers. It is the player's responsability to use it properly.

Systems provoking all kinds of lags (slowing machine, fps loss...) are most likely to be **removed** of a player's base **%(#BE0000)[with or without warning]**. Same for oversized or non-optimised bases.

You can ask the staff team to check whether or not your base is producing lags. You can also see yourself beeing proposed an alternative to optimise it.

**Not a single refund will be done**, except in specific cases (victim of a grief in your claim zone). The team will chose whether or not you should get a refund.


Abusive donations toward a player in any way (energy or items), or anything that allows an easier experience is against our way of playing. This is why it also is forbidden.

⚙️ - Specific rules in Minecraft
--
He is of fact that our servers are publics, he must therefore be **share** the servers resources. **effectively you are not on a singleplayer map**.

**The restrictions are therefore as the next ...**

- only once quarry per person in the world mining (Authorized only in the mining world).
- The buildcraft pipes are to be used in a limited quantity (use for apiary, grinder)
- No falling spawner has tolerate(falling entity). **three spawners active at the same time per base ** with an extinction system when the player is not connected.
- The moving of mobs via fan,conveyer belt or any other system of the same type.
- The micro-blocks are to limit or avoid in your base.

The spawners or all type of machine/system creating entities should not allow their accumulation.


many tutorials and optimization are at your disposition [Here](https://forum.mineaurion.com/category/35/tutoriels). Some was use as a reference; for example [The automation of spawners](https://forum.mineaurion.com/topic/397/tutoriel-pour-optimisation-des-machines).

After many problems in the server bound to conflicts between players of the same base, we have decided the next thing :

- If a person leave the base without warning, taking all the machines with him, this will be considered as a steal, and sanctions will be applied.
- If the player can not agree, we will then make half with the resources concerned.
- if never the situation degenerate we will delete the base entirely and the players will have to start again from the beginning.

For this situation, the decision remains at the staff assessment.

**The Additional rules are provided in the "/rules" of each server.**
